**Exercism exercises in Wren**

This is the Wren track, one of the many tracks on [Exercism][web-exercism].
It holds all the _exercises_ that are currently implemented and available for students to complete.
The track currently consists only of _practice_ exercises at the moment (no concepts).
You can find this in the [`config.json`][file-config].

## Running the test suite

**Prerequisites**

First we need to install dependencies:

```
wrenc package.wren install
```

**Running the tests**

```shell
./scripts/ci
```

This runs the tests for all sample solutions.

```shell
./scripts/ci hello-world
```

If the a single argument is passed, only _that_ exercise is tested.

### Maintainers

To update all the individual `package.wren` files in every exercise:

```
./script/update_testie.sh
```
