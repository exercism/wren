## Implementaton Notes

The test suite passes a Function class instance to the `keep` and `discard` methods as a [block argument][block-argument].
To successfully pass the tests, you'll need to call that function inside your code.
If you're unfamiliar with how to do this, please consult the [Function class documentation][function-class].
