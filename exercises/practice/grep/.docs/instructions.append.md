## "io" module

You'll need to read from files in this exercise.
The required `File` class is in the `io` module.
It is described in the [documentation for the Wren CLI project][wren-cli].

(Note that the `wren-console` project [extends the `io` module][wren-console] with a few methods,
although these are not needed for this exercise.)
